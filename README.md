# Pipeline-ALICE  

This repository outlines the data pipeline for ALICE data from United Way.

All data is stored in a SQLite database called ALICE that is located in the "Outputs" folder. A guide to this database called "DB_ALICE_Metadata.xlsx" is located in the "Outputs" folder and should be updated whenever a new data series is added or updated.
